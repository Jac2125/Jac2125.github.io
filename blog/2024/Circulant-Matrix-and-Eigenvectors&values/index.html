Problem</h1> <p>![[Pasted image 20241029213125.png]] Here is the proposition regarding the eigenvalues of Laplacian Matrix $C_n$ While reading the proof of this proposition, I have encoutered to a question of the following: ![[Pasted image 20241029213250.png]] the equation 4.6 to 4.8 is pretty straight forward, but it took me some time to understand this part: <strong>If $P$ is a cyclic permutation, then $P\vec{x}$ is also an eigenvector for $\lambda$. This means that $\vec{x}, P\vec{x},…,P^{n-1} \vec{x}$</strong> are all eigenvectors of $\lambda$ I did some of the research what the cyclic permutation is meaning and studying about topics related circulant matrix, which was also very interesting. So I wanted to write my own proof about this but it is not clear if this is really a “proof” (I am not sure if this proof can be a rigorous proof on this)</p> <p>Proposition: Let $\vec{x}$ be an eigenvector of $L_{C_n}$. If $P$ is a cyclic permutation, then $P\vec{x}$ is also an eigenvector for $\lambda$. This means that $\vec{x}, P\vec{x},…,P^{n-1} \vec{x}$</p> <p>The laplacian matrix of $C_n$ has the form \(\begin{bmatrix}2 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; ... &amp; -1 \\ -1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1 &amp; ... &amp; 0\\ \vdots &amp; &amp; \ddots &amp; &amp; \vdots\\ 0 &amp; ... &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\ -1 &amp; ... &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\ \end{bmatrix}\) Then</p> <p>I realized it: next we study <strong>fourier analysis</strong> to understand the rest of the proofs</p> </body></html>
