For an edge ${u, v} \in E$, we define an $n \times n$ matrix $L_{G_{{u,v}}}$ by \(l_{G_{(u,v)}}(i,j) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{if } i = j \text{ and } i \in \{u,v\}, \\ -1 &amp; \text{if } i = u \text{ and } j = v, \text{ or vice versa,} \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}\)</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>[!Definition 3.2] For a graph $G = (V, E), L_G = \sum_{{u, v} \in E} L_{G_{u, v}}$</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="theorem-33">Theorem 3.3</h3> <p>The eigenvalues of a self adjoint matrix are all real <em>proof.</em> Suppose $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the self adjoint matrix $L$ and $v$ is a nonzero eigenvector of $\lambda$. \(\begin{align*} \lambda||v||^2 &amp;= \lambda\langle v,v \rangle \\ &amp;= \langle \lambda v,v \rangle \end{align*}\)</p> <blockquote> <p>[!Definition 3.4] An $n \times n$ matrix $M$ is called positive-semidefinite if $\underline{x}^{T}M\underline{x} \geq 0$ for all $\underline{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="theorem-35">Theorem 3.5</h2> <p>For a graph $G$, every eigenvalue of $L_G$ is non-negative.</p> <p><strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue and $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a nonzero eigenvector of $\lambda$. Then \(\mathbf{x}^T L_G \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^T (\lambda \mathbf{x}) = \lambda (\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{x}).\) Since $\mathbf{x}^T L_G \mathbf{x} &gt; 0$ and $\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{x} &gt; 0$, we have $\lambda &gt; 0$. $\square$</p> <p>As we have noted, the Laplacian matrix $L_G$ is self-adjoint and consists of real entries. Thus the Real Spectral Theorem states that $L_G$ has an orthonormal basis consisting of eigenvectors of $L_G$. Therefore, for a graph $G$ of $n$ vertices, we can find $n$ eigenvalues (not necessarily distinct) for $L_G$. We denote them as $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n$. Since they are all real and non-negative, we assume that \(0 &lt; \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \cdots \leq \lambda_n.\)</p> <p>Now we prove some fundamental facts about Laplacians. Recall that in the previous section we mentioned that the eigenvalues of the Laplacian tell us how connected a graph is. Now, we define connectedness.

So \(U_{i} = \text{Span}(\{\mathbf{w}_1, \mathbf{w}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_k\}).\)</p> <p>It is clear that $\mathbf{w}_1, \mathbf{w}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_k$ are linearly independent.
